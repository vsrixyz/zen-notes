### Anatomy of a notification

- Primary content (this isn't really defined)
- People in the form of an avatar
- Actions
	- Expandable notifications are revealed by tapping an indicator icon

### When not to use a notification

- Cross-promotion, or advertising another product
- An app that a user has never opened
- Messages that encourage the user to engage with no direct value "Haven't seen you in a while"
- Operations that don't require user involvement, like syncing information
- Error states from which the app may recover without user interaction
